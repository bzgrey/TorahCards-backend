# Major changes to design for assignment 4b,c

- I decided not to implement the labeling concept in the frontend because I felt that my webapp worked well without it, and given time constraints, it wasn't worth putting resources to it.
- I added search queries to the Notes and Flashcards concepts to enable a search page in the frontend.
-  I created and implemented a new UserAuth authentication concept which was important for having different users.
- I added basic information queries, given id's for concepts
