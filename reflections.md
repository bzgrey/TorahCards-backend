# TorahCards: Project Reflections

## Project Experience Overview

### What Was Hard or Easy
- If found it hard to design the look of the ui in terms of colors and style and integrate it in the frontend without just asking an llm to do it
- I found it easy to understand the concepts, but coding the syncs was a little more confusing.

### What Went Well
- Iterating on the concept design went well for me. It felt quite natural the progression that we built the app in, from concepts and backend, to frontend.

## Mistakes & Learning
- **Mistake:** When coding the frontend, I originally tried to have the agent code everything at once, which was a mess. I realized eventually I had to start over.
  - **How to avoid:** Plan ahead incremental ways of using the llm

## Skills Development

### Skills Acquired
- I better understand modular concept design and syncs
- I am better at using llms when coding for the right tasks efficiently

### Skills Needing Further Development
- I could still use development in planning out my work in a more efficient way.
- Even though I improved in my usage of the llms, it could still use more improvement.

## AI-Assisted Development

### Using the Context Tool
- **How I used it:** To code the concepts and tests and so forth as well as the syncs
- **What worked well:** It put together the concepts well, and I didn't have to iterate on them that much
- **Challenges encountered:** The syncs weren't the best, so I had to modify them a lot. I also was not great at iterating within the same markdown file.

### Using Agentic Coding Tools
- **Tools used:** Github Copilot
- **Use cases:** Frontend coding, implementation of ui design throuhgout styles, debugging
- **Effectiveness:** Very affective at coding a lot up
- **Limitations observed:** It can get out of hand in a way that it is hard to edit that which has been coded if you don't understand everything along the way like the css.

## Conclusions on LLMs in Software Development

- I think they are useful in improving efficiency, but they need to be use with caution to make sure everything is understood along the way.
